### Difficulties faced during development
- I was never much introduce to development field(except some basics of DJANGO), so it took 4-5 days in learning the concepts of React, authorization with Oauth2 and working with API. Making Login with CodeChef Credentials (using the CodeChef API OAuth) was one of the difficult part.
